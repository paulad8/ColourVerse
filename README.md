### PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To create a website with a single main page displaying randomly selected images removed from a separate portfolio page. 

### PROJECT CONCEPT
Art Space is a website that showcases selected artwork from a range of pioneering artists from the Early Renaissance to modern times. Around 40 artists will be showcased with a short biography and a selection of notable works.
All works and artists will be searchable by movement (style), region and medium. Users will also be able to search by keyword and be presented with the search result displayed on a new page with the keyword displayed as the header and results organised in a grided card format. 

#### USER OBJECTIVES
- Art is for everybody.
- Art is to inspire.
- Art is joy.
- I am bringing key movements in art history and pioneering masters to the user. To move, to inspire, to educate.  

#### SITE OWNER OBJECTIVES
- Demonstrate competency in the languages and frameworks studied under the Full Stack Development journey
- Create an artwork repository that is compelling and engaging and applies UX principles effectively. 
- Design a visually appealing, fully responsive and accessible website
- Challenge myself by incorporating my newly acquired programming knowledge with my design background.

### DESIGN


#### COLOUR PALETTE 
Consistent across all devices, and to complement and distract the artworks on display, I have chosen a background with a gradient of soft muted hues of lavender and pink. Components complement in purple with a similar subtle range of interaction states.

#### TYPOGRAPHY
Google Fonts are incorporated into the website: **Major Mono Display** for the heading and subheadings and **Poppins** for all other scales with a standard sans serif fallback. Major Mono Display was selected to reflect the site's arty aspect, while Poppins is legible and clear.
